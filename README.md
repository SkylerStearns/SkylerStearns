# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Skyler. I'm a Full Stack Web Developer


### ðŸ˜Ž Quick Bio:
I started my Web Development Career as a Quality Assurance Engineer in August 2019.
As I became more comfortable with discovering bugs and diagnosing issues for my team, I took the next step, and began learning how to fix things myself.
One thing led to another, and now I'm a full time Full Stack Developer! I primarily enjoy Front-End development, but I also have some experience in some Back-End.
