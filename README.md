# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Skyler. I'm a Front End Web Developer


### ðŸ˜Ž Quick Bio:
```
I started my Web Development Career as a Quality Assurance Engineer in mid 2019.
As I became more comfortable with discovering bugs and diagnosing issues for my team, I took the next step, and began learning how to fix them myself.
One thing led to another, and now I'm a full time Front End Developer!
